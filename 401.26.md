***Library***
Library is a collection of reusable functions used by computer programs meaning the resources which you can reuse which may include classes, subroutines, pre-compiled code, message templates, etc.

***Framework***
Framework is a piece of code that dictates how the project should be structured and run. It simply mandates the architecture of your project like defining the design parameters of an application so that you can focus on the specifics of the project, thereby emphasizing on reusability of design rather than reusability of code.

|State| A simple example we might have for state might be for modeling a light switch. A light switch has some sort of mechanism we can flip from "On" to "Off". Whether the switch is in the "On" position or the "Off" position is something we could call the "state" of the light switch. We can model this using a React Component like the following.|
