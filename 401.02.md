# Classes, Inheritance, Functional Programming


1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
  * Anytime you would be using the JavaScript on the backend.
2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
  * A module is a resuable block of code while a packages are libraries and applications used to help build out the program.
3. What does the node package manager do?
  * It is how we pull the libraries we want to use of the web and insert them into our program.
4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module

  ```module.exports.cheese = cheese;```
  ```module.exports = {Cheese: Cheese}```
  ```module.cheese = 'cheese';```

| Term | Definition |
|------|:-----------|
|ecosystem| The JavaScript ecosystem is a collection of software packages, libraries, and other resources that facilitate development as they integrate with each other. |
|Node.js| Node.jsâ€™ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.|
|V8 Engine| V8 is an open source runtime engine written in C++. V8 implements a script called ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262. ECMAScript was created by Ecma International to standardize JavaScript. Tere are many different JavaScript runtime engines apart from V8 by Chrome like SpiderMonkey by Mozilla, Chakra by Microsoft, etc.|
|module| A Node module is a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code.|
|package| A plethora of Node.js libraries and applications are published on npm, and many more are added every day|
|node package manager (```npm```)| These are libraries built by the awesome community which will solve most of your generic problems. npm (Node package manager) has packages you can use in your apps to make your development faster and efficient.|
|server| a computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network|
|environment| By far, the most common host environment for JavaScript is web browsers. Web browsers typically use the public API to create host objects responsible for reflecting the DOM into JavaScript. Another common application for JavaScript is as a (Web) server side scripting language.|
|interpreter|  The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines utilize just-in-time compilationfor improved performance. JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browservendors, and every major browser has one.|
|compiler| The compile () method was deprecated in JavaScript version 1.5. The compile () method is used to compile a regular expression during execution of a script. The compile () method can also be used to change and recompile a regular expression.|
