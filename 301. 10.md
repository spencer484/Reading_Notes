### The Call Stack and Debugging

**What is the Call Stack?**

A "todo list" of function invocations

Last In - First Out
Like a stack of books

**The key takeaways from the call stack are:**
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.

**Types of error messages**
The first thing that indicates you that something is wrong with your code is the (in)famous error message that the one we saw just moments ago, it usually appears on your console (being developer tools of the browser, terminal or whatever else you are using).

* Reference errors
* Syntax errors
* Range errors
* Type errors
