# Access Control (ACL)

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret.

The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token. Even if this scheme comes from an OAuth2 specification, you can still use it in any other context where tokens are exchange between a client and a server.

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?

n order to keep track of who is logged in, we will be using JSON web tokens (JWTs). JWTs are a structured way to keep data secure and to make sure that data has not been tampered with along the request/response cycle.

There are three parts to a JWT: the header, the body, and the signature. The header holds data about the JWT itself and the signature signs the JWT. The body is where we will actually store the information we want.


|Term| Definition|
|----|-----------|
|encryption| Encryption in encoding technique in which message is encoded by using encryption algorithm in such a way that only authorized personnel can access the message or information.|
|token| JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.|
|bearer| Bearer authentication is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:
|secret| A private piece of information that can be attached to a signature to prove authenticity of a token|
|JSON Web Token| In order to keep track of who is logged in, we will be using JSON web tokens (JWTs). JWTs are a structured way to keep data secure and to make sure that data has not been tampered with along the request/response cycle.|
