###### How to Solve Programming Problems

**A simple set of steps**

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

Read the problem completely twice

**Solve the problem manually**

*Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!*

* Write “Zebra” down.
* Start a new word, and put “a” as the first letter.  (Why –> because it is the last letter, we want to start here)
* Put “r” down as the 2nd letter.  (Why –> because it is the next letter backwards from the last letter we copied)
* Put “b” down as the 3rd letter.  (Why –> same as above)
* Etc


###### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

Honestly I don't like this article as much. I get what the author is trying to say but I disagree with Tim Ferris that laziness is being too busy. I feel like I take a lot on my plate as a husband, brother, friend, and someone everyone knows they can count on at any time for just about anything. I think the biggest thing is about how you manage your time. Now I am writting this I am thinking that's kind of what they are talking about. Managing time.

###### 5 Whys

**How to use the 5 Whys**

1. Assemble a Team

Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. Define the Problem

If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

3. Ask the First "Why?"

Ask your team why the problem is occurring. Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

Try to move quickly from one question to the next, so that you have the full picture before you jump to any conclusions.

5. Know When to Stop

You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.

6. Address the Root Cause(s)

Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

7. Monitor Your Measures

Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
