###### How to Solve Programming Problems

**A simple set of steps**

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

Read the problem completely twice

**Solve the problem manually**

*Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!*

* Write “Zebra” down.
* Start a new word, and put “a” as the first letter.  (Why –> because it is the last letter, we want to start here)
* Put “r” down as the 2nd letter.  (Why –> because it is the next letter backwards from the last letter we copied)
* Put “b” down as the 3rd letter.  (Why –> same as above)
* Etc


###### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

Honestly I don't like this article as much. I get what the author is trying to say but I disagree with Tim Ferris that laziness is being too busy. I feel like I take a lot on my plate as a husband, brother, friend, and someone everyone knows they can count on at any time for just about anything. I think the biggest thing is about how you manage your time. Now I am writting this I am thinking that's kind of what they are talking about. Managing time.
