# Express Routing & Connected API

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

-This could be things like checking if a user is authenticated, logging data for analytics, or anything else we'd like to do before we actually spit out information to our user

2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?

-True

3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

- By using res.send() or res.end()

4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

-The order you place your middleware and routes is very important. Everything will happen in the order that they appear. This means that if you place your middleware after a route, then the route will happen before the middleware and the request will end there. Your middleware will not run at that point.

5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

-When more than one response is trying to be sent to the client. For instance, if you forget to write code to have it exit the function


| Term | Definition |
|------|:-----------|
|Middleware| Software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network.|
|Request Object| The Request object retrieves the values that the client browser passed to the server during an HTTP request. Methods. The Request object defines the following method. Retrieves data sent to the server from the client as part of a POST request.|
|Response Object| The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.|
|Application Middleware| Middleware in the context of distributed applications is software that provides services beyond those provided by the operating system to enable the various components of a distributed system to communicate and manage data. Middleware supports and simplifies complex distributed applications.|
|Routing Middleware| Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.|
