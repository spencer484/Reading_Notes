###### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team


This is a interesting into because I feel like I could relate in a lot of ways with Rozovsky. I have worked hard over the years to put myself out there more. This can be hard in group settings because like the author noted, a lot of times groups naturally form into leaders and other followers. Which I think can be just fine. But there has to be a balance of being "heard". Everyone needs to take in others perspectives even if they are not the leader. Sounds like her case-competition group was the best case scenario.

Now we are talking about employee productivity. They say that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. I believe this to be very true. I've seen it many times myself being stuck on a issue with my code and then I get a fresh pair of eyes on it and within 2 minutes someone has found the issue. Building this into a strong team is a huge asset.

It's interesting how Google initial opinion of how a effective team was run was actually wrong. "Put introverts together". "More effective when everyone is friends away from work". But really no one had studied this. This is really interesting in the middle of the article to find out that they couldn't find many patterns. They teams were effective in self regulating themselves. 

###### "Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking"
###### "Average social sensitivity"

Overall it seems like it's how you treat others in the group. Let others speak but also speak yourself. Offer what you can but also be receptive to others.
