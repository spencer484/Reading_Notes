1. Why is authentication important?

This is the process of ensuring that the user logging in is who he or she claims to be. We do this by comparing the submitted password to the one stored in the database for the given email address or username.

2. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?

Hashing, data is converted to the hash using some hashing function, which can be any number generated from string or text. Where encryption in encoding technique in which message is encoded by using encryption algorithm in such a way that only authorized personnel can access the message or information.

3. What is the difference between encryption and encoding?

Encryption in encoding technique in which message is encoded by using encryption algorithm in such a way that only authorized personnel can access the message or information. In the Encoding method, data is transformed from one form to another. The main aim of encoding is to transform data into a form that is readable by most of the systems or that can be used by any external process.

4. What is a token used for?

In order to keep track of who is logged in, we will be using JSON web tokens (JWTs). JWTs are a structured way to keep data secure and to make sure that data has not been tampered with along the request/response cycle.


|Term| Definition|
|----|-----------|
|authentication| This is the process of ensuring that the user logging in is who he or she claims to be. We do this by comparing the submitted password to the one stored in the database for the given email address or username. In practice, we compare a hashed version of both the submitted and stored password for additional security. If the two password hashes match, the user is authentic.|
|authorization| Now that we know who is making a request (or not if the user is not logged in), we need to determine whether he or she has permission to access the requested resource. You can think of it as checking to see whether a particular key fits a specific door. For example, if you go to Facebook, you should only be authorized to view and make edits to your profile page. You should not be authorized to make edits or view sensitive information in others' pages.|
|encryption| The process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access|
|hashing| Hashing is the practice of taking a string or input key, a variable created for storing narrative data, and representing it with a hash value, which is typically determined by an algorithm and constitutes a much shorter string than the original.|
|session| a session is a storage that consists of information on server-side. JavaScript Session will be in active state till the user interacts with a website or web application. As a replacement to cookies that store constantly changing data in userâ€™s browser, a unique identifier is stored on client side known as Session Id.|
|cookie| HTTP cookies are a way that we can send information between the server and the client. They will be sent from the server, and then stored in the browser in some fashion. This information will be kept in the browser while the user is interacting with the website.|
|token| JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.|
|Basic Auth| Basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request.|
|encoding| Memory has the ability to encode, store and recall information. Memories give an organism the capability to learn and adapt from previous experiences as well as build relationships. Encoding allows a perceived item of use or interest to be converted into a construct that can be stored within the brain and recalled later from long-term memory. Working memory stores information for immediate use or manipulation which is aided through hooking onto previously archived items already present in the long-term memory of an individual.|
|secret| A private piece of information that can be attached to a signature to prove authenticity of a token|
