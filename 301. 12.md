### EJS Partials

Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

**Example of a header:**

```<!-- views/partials/navbar.ejs -->
    <div class="header clearfix">
        <nav>
            <ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">
                <li role="presentation"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-muted">Node.js Blog</h3>
        </nav>
    </div>
 ```
    
In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters (you could change these delimiters if you really wanted to). Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %> where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
