### APIs Continued...

###### What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) in a general sense is a contract that governs how different parts of an application interact. A web API, which is what we'll be focusing on, is neither a server nor a database; rather, it is a set of HTTP endpoints and the rules we need to follow to both retrieve data from and make changes to resources through the service. You can think of web APIs as middlemen for our web apps; they sit in between our frontend code and the actual databases backing them.

#### HTTP Methods

###### Forms, Data Transferring, and Routing Rules
The modern internet is user-driven; all the actual content of a website is generated by the users of a website. How does the user manage to get his or her data to the page? One word: forms. The HTML form is a way in which users are able to pass data to the back end of a website where data can be processed and stored. Designing forms and processing the information correctly is a huge part of what it takes to become a back-end developer.

###### HTTP Methods:
If you are not already familiar with HTTP request methods, here's a brief run-down:

* GET is used for passing insensitive information
* POST is used for passing sensitive information.
* PUT is used for passing updating whole sensitive information.
* PATCH is used for passing updating pieces of sensitive information.
* DELETE is used for passing deleting sensitive information.

###### What is Express? 

Express.js is a framework written in JavaScript which acts as an interface to Node's server functionality. It is also the E in the MERN stack, so it must be important! Express allows us to create a robust server with more or less whatever architecture we choose.
