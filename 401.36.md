# Application State with Redux


1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

An important thing to remember is that there are many different types of attacks. One type of attack is a "man-in-the-middle" attack. In this type of attack, a hacker can get between, or "in the middle" of a request and grab the information. A way to make this more difficult is to make sure that the cookies are only sent during secure sessions, that is via "https". It is not very necessary to set this up during development and requires extra configuration.

2. Explain 3rd party cookies.

Third-party cookies are those that do not originate from the website operator, but from a third party – such as an advertiser. If you visit a website for the first time, the web server usually generates a so-called first-party cookie, which stores all the necessary settings and inputs of the user. When you return to the site, this first-party cookie is read to retrieve settings and other information such as log-in information. This improves usability.

3. How do pixel tags work?

A tracking pixel is an HTML code snippet which is loaded when a user visits a website or opens an email. It is useful for tracking user behavior and conversions. With a tracking pixel, advertisers can acquire data for online marketing, web analysis or email marketing. With log file analysis, long data evaluation or using appropriate analytical tools, this data can be used for different purposes, for example retargeting.

### Cookies and JWT

We will be saving our JWT that contains the user's id in a cookie. Although there is not any particularly sensitive information in the cookie, the JWT itself is sensitive. One does not necessarily need the information in the JWT; just the JWT itself. If the cookie is not properly guarded, it can be compromised via javascript, such as a cross site scripting attack. So, we will make sure these cookies are "HttpOnly". This means that the cookies are essentially invisible to client-side JavaScript and can only be read by the server.

### Cookies in Express

In order to use cookies in express, we will need to install an extra dependency: cookie-parser. Run npm install cookie-parser. Next, go to your server.js and include the following new lines of code:

```
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
...
app.use(cookieParser());
// Change the app.use(cors()) to the one below
app.use(cors({credentials: true, origin: 'http://localhost:3000'}));
```

Now our app has the abilities to send and read cookies with each request/response.

In a given response, we can set a cookie via the following:

```
res.cookie("mycookie", "mydata", { httpOnly: true }).json({
  message: "This response has a cookie"
});
```

### Authorization and Middleware

By now we've used a bit of Middleware, and it's finally time for us to write our own.

Let's add in a new file in our config folder and call it jwt.config.js.

```
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
 
module.exports.authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
  jwt.verify(req.cookies.usertoken, process.env.SECRET_KEY, (err, payload) => {
    if (err) { 
      res.status(401).json({verified: false});
    } else {
      next();
    }
  });
}
```

The "authenticate" function takes a few arguments, the request and response that we are familiar with, but it also takes the "next" function we've seen a few times already. The function then checks the "usertoken" cookie that should be present inside of the "cookies" object of request with the secret we used when signing it. We then add in a callback function that receives errors and a payload (the information stored in the cookie). If there are errors, we can reply with a 401 status code and pass back an object signifying the user attempting to access the route is not authenticated.
