# Message Queues

1. What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?

That data can be sent both directions from client to server and vice versa

2. Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?

Even when websockets can be used, the initial connection setup it done over HTTP. Also, a socket.io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code through /socket.io/socket.io.js.

3. What happens when a client emits an event?

One request from the client asks the server to watch for any and all messages sent from other clients. If a message is sent to the server, the server will send down that message to all connected clients without the need for the client to make another HTTP request.

4. What happens when a server emits an event?

With sockets, the individual clients don't communicate directly with one another; instead all communications must pass through the server. There are multiple ways for the server to emit events to connected clients, depending on which clients you intend to reach.

5. What happens if a client “misses” an event?

Who? What?



|Term|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Web Socket|WebSockets are a connection-based communication protocol. Unlike TCP, WebSockets work in the browser. WebSockets are message-based so we can send a message and the other side receives a message. WebSockets are implemented on top of TCP.|
|Socket.io| Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.|
|Client|One end of the client/server socket connection. Connects to the servers port to send and recieves messages. Sends messages only to the server.|
|Server|When we are speaking about WebSockets, the server listens on a fixed port, with a given socket. Server accepts the connection, and accept/ returns a new socket for the connection.|
