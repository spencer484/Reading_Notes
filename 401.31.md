# Hooks API

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

React can be used to build a single page application or SPA, which will make our website feel more responsive by eliminating page loads for our users

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

     * Outside the ```<BrowserRouter/>```
        
  
     * Inside the ```<BrowserRouter />```, outside a ```<Route />```
  
  
     * Inside a ```<Route />```
  
3. What does props.children contain?

My simple explanation of what this.props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

A simple example:

Hereâ€™s an example of a stateless function that is used to create a component. Again, since this is a function, there is no this keyword so just use props.children

```
const Picture = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={props.src}/>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  )
}
```


|Term|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Composition| The approach to use multiple components together in React.js|
|Children / Child Components| Children make React components feel like markup instead of disjointed entities. Using the power of JavaScript and some React helper functions we can work with them to create declarative APIs and make our lives easier.|
|Hash Routing| The routing module uses the hash to define unique URLs for each form, page or whatever your app is showing.|
|Link Routing| Traditionally, this is done with an html a tag and an href attribute. However, a <Link> component will not refresh the page. It will simply change the url and change the DOM.|
