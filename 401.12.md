# Bearer Authorization

1. Write the following steps in the correct order:
* Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
* Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
* Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
* Receive authorization code
* Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
* Receive access token
* Make a request to the access token endpoint

2. What can you do with an authorization code?

* Get an access token

3. What can you do with an access token?

* Allows user to access specific routes and data

4. What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

* A lot more secure


|Term| Definition|
|----|-----------|
|Client ID| The client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it’s public, it’s best that it isn’t guessable by third parties, so many implementations use something like a 32-character hex string. It must also be unique across all clients that the authorization server handles. If the client ID is guessable, it makes it slightly easier to craft phishing attacks against arbitrary applications.|
|Client Secret| The client_secret is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server. It must be sufficiently random to not be guessable, which means you should avoid using common UUID libraries which often take into account the timestamp or MAC address of the server generating it. A great way to generate a secure secret is to use a cryptographically-secure library to generate a 256-bit value and converting it to a hexadecimal representation.|
|Authentication Endpoint| Endpoint authentication is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service. The approach is also known as device authentication.|
|Access Token Endpoint| Authorization/Authentication Endpoint The authorization endpoint can be used to request either access tokens or authorization codes (implicit and authorization code flow). You either use a web browser or a web view to start the process.|
|API Endpoint| An API endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting. It refers to touchpoints of the communication between an API and a server.|
|Authorization Code| An authorization code is typically a sequence of letters, numbers, or a combination of both, that validates a person's identity, approves a transaction or provides access to a secured area.|
|Access Token| An access token contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, the user's groups, the user's privileges, and, in some cases, a particular application. Typically one may be asked to enter the access token (e.g. 40 random characters) rather than the usual password (it therefore should be kept secret just like a password).|
