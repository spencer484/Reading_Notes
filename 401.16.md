# Event Driven Applications

### Event-Driven Programming in Node.js

Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article we’re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.

###### EventEmitter

Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.

```
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const chatRoomEvents = new EventEmitter;

function userJoined(username){
  // Assuming we already have a function to alert all users.
  alertAllUsers('User ' + username + ' has joined the chat.');
}

// Run the userJoined function when a 'userJoined' event is triggered.
chatRoomEvents.on('userJoined', userJoined);
```

###### Removing Listeners

To remove event listeners in EventEmitter we can use the removeListener or removeAllListeners method. It’s important to note that in the EventEmitter that comes built-in with Node you must pass a reference to the exact function you wish to remove when using the removeListener method. 


```
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const chatRoomEvents = new EventEmitter;

function displayMessage(message){
  document.write(message);
}

function userJoined(username){
  chatRoomEvents.on('message', displayMessage);
}

chatRoomEvents.on('userJoined', userJoined);
```


###### Object Oriented Programming + Event-Driven Programming

The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.


```
class Food {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  becomeEaten() {
    return 'I have been eaten.';
  }
}

var bacon = new Food('bacon');

class gator {
  eat() {
    bacon.becomeEaten();
  }
}
```
