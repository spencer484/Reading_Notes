### Forms and Events

###### Forms

You could argue that forms are the most important part of a webpage. It includes everything from a Google search bar, facebook login, uploading files, etc...
It is how the user interacts with the webpage and usually how we can gather data from that user. The main pieces of the form is the label and the input.

###### List Tables Forms

List and Tables are a great way to show the data you have taken in from a user and rendering it on the page. Or maybe show data from many users or inputs. 

###### Events

Just like forms are great way to have the user interact and give data. If you dive deeper into what is really happening there is usually some sort of a event that is happening 
in the background. There are a lot of different types of events.

* UI Events
* Keyboard Events
* Mouse Events
* Focus Events
* Form Events
* Mutation Events

All of these are ways that a user can interact with the webpage.
