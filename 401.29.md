# Routing

1. Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?

Passing props is how parents and children can communicate typically so I would say no. If two components that don't have a child parent relationship, we can use ```compononentDidMount() componentWillUnMount() and setState()```. We can also expose a method on the child component for the parent to call. I can pass a child component data in my parent component as a prop to the child when I instantiate it within the parent.

2. When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?

It goes to the parent component and renders.

```
<Main>
  <Content />
</Main>
```

3. Can a component, such as ```<Content />```, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?

Yes.

4. What trick can a parent use to share all ```props``` with it’s children

Use the spread operator.


**Props.children**
Props.children is available on every component. It contains the content between the opening and closing tags of a component. For example:
```
<Welcome>Hello world!</Welcome>
```
The string Hello world! is available in props.children in the Welcome component:

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <p>{props.children}</p>;
}
```
For components defined as classes, use this.props.children:

```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.children}</p>;
  }
}
```

**Composition**
In programming, composition allows you to build more complex functionality by combining small and focused functions.

For example, think about using map() to create a new array from an initial set, and then filtering the result using filter():

```
const list = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Egg']
list.map(item => item[0]).filter(item => item === 'A') //'A'
```

In React, composition allows you to have some pretty cool advantages.
