### HTTP and REST

1. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.

2. What is the advantage of an ORM, like Mongoose?
  
  * You get to write in the language you are already using anyway.
  * It abstracts away the database system so that switching from MySQL to PostgreSQL, or whatever flavor you prefer, is easy-peasy.
  * Depending on the ORM you get a lot of advanced features out of the box, such as support for transactions, connection pooling, migrations, seeds, streams, and all sorts of other goodies.

3. How does the repository pattern compare with an ORM?

ORM solutions are useful to facilitate data-driven API development. Users have concrete needs which drive the data model of an application. In legacy development, this data architecture is typically implemented and version controlled using database scripts such as SQL scripts

4. When making a repository/facade, what flexibility do you gain?

URLs reveal the identity of the particular host with which we want to communicate, but the action that should be performed on the host is specified via HTTP verbs. Of course, there are several actions that a client would like the host to perform. HTTP has formalized on a few that capture the essentials that are universally applicable for all kinds of applications.

5. Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
  
  * MongoDB Atlas
  * Microsoft Azure
  * Amazon DynamoDB

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
|lifecycle| Stages data goes through from start to when archieved. 6 Stages: Generation, Maintence, Active use, Publication, Archieving, Purging|
|collections| non-relational collection of data storage|
|the “Repository” design pattern| The Repository pattern implements separation of concerns by abstracting the data persistence logic in your applications|
|mongoose middleware| Middleware are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous functions. Mongoose has two types: document middleware and query middleware
|Object Relation Mapping (ORM)| Object-relational-mapping is the idea of being able to write queries like the one above, as well as much more complicated ones, using the object-oriented paradigm of your preferred programming language.|
