1. Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does

The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element

2. Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does

The reduce() method reduces a array to a single value.

3. Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result

  * With normal Promise .then() syntax
  
  	```superagent.get(url).then((data) => {
		const bookArray = data.body.items;
		const finalBookArray = bookArray.map((value) => new Book(value.volumeInfo));
		response.render('pages/searches/show', { bookResults: finalBookArray });
	});```
  
  * Again with async / await syntax
  
    ```return superagent.get(url)
    .set('Authorization', longKey)
    .then(results => {

      let items = JSON.parse(results.text).items
      for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
        let total = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < items[i].answers.length; j++) {
          if (items[i].answers[j].choice.label === 'True') {
            total++;
          }
        }
        arrayOfResults.push(total);
      }
      return arrayOfResults;
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log('error', err)
    })```
  
4. Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student

A promise in JavaScript is similar to a promise in real life. When we make a promise in real life, it is a guarantee that we are going to do something in the future. Because promises can only be made for the future. A promise has 2 possible outcomes: it will either be kept when the time comes, or it wonâ€™t.
This is also the same for promises in JavaScript. When we define a promise in JavaScript, it will be resolved when the time comes, or it will get rejected.

5. Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?

Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors
