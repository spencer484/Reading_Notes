### Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions

###### REGEX
Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).

## Basic Topics

* Anchors — ^ and $
* Quantifiers — * + ? and {}
* OR operator — | or []
* Character classes — \d \w \s and .
* Flags

## Intermediate topics

* Bracket expressions — []
* Greedy and Lazy match

Advanced topics

* Boundaries — \b and \B
* Back-references — \1
* Look-ahead and Look-behind — (?=) and (?<=)

###### CSS GRID

## Properties for the Parent

* Display
* Grid-template-columns
* grid-template-rows
* Grid-template-areas
* Grid-template
* Gap-grid-gap
* Justify-items
* Align-items
* Place-items
* Justify-content
* Align-content

Wow this is a lot of information! I have tried to work with Grid before with a little success. The ideas of the columns and rows makes a ton of sense but definitely need more practice.
