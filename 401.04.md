1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?

Data Model objects typically don't have much behavior hence using something like a constructor function for attaching methods isn't needed. However, I believe there are several other reasons why wrapping Data Model still makes sense.

* A Dictionary

* More Readable Creation

* Single Place to Change

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?

To create, read, update and delete

3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?

Postgres is a SQL database. MondoDB is a NoSQL database the acronym NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL". What this means is that while NoSQL does support a structured query language (SQL) there is more flexibility in the storage of the data other than just basic tabular storage (a.k.a housing data in tables). Most importantly, the concept of NoSQL databases emphasizes that there are no relations between the data. Think of it this way:

***In a NoSQL environment, every piece of data is unaware of the other pieces.***

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?

The most popular way of using MongoDB with Node and Express is with a library called Mongoose.  Mongoose simplifies making MongoDB queries with its own library of methods.  This means that we can connect mongoose directly to a MongoDB database and it will allow us to give more structure to our data with the addition of models and schemas. Mongoose will act as a layer between our application and our database enabling us to do things like validate and run complex queries more effectively.


| Term | Definition |
|------|:-----------|
database| A database is a data structure that stores organized information. Most databases contain multiple tables, which may each include several different fields.|
CRUD| Create, Read, Update Delete|
schema| A schema is an outline, diagram, or model.|
Structured Query Language (SQL)| Stands for "Structured Query Language," and can be pronounced as either "sequel" or "S-Q-L." It is a query language used for accessing and modifying information in a database. Some common SQL commands include "insert," "update," and "delete."|
Non SQL (NoSQL)| NoSQL does support a structured query language (SQL) there is more flexibility in the storage of the data other than just basic tabular storage (a.k.a housing data in tables). Most importantly, the concept of NoSQL databases emphasizes that there are no relations between the data.|
MongoDB| MongoDB is a NoSQL database.  Well great, but what is a NoSQL database??  The acronym NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL". What this means is that while NoSQL does support a structured query language (SQL) there is more flexibility in the storage of the data other than just basic tabular storage (a.k.a housing data in tables). Most importantly, the concept of NoSQL databases emphasizes that there are no relations between the data.|
Mongoose| Mongoose simplifies making MongoDB queries with its own library of methods.  This means that we can connect mongoose directly to a MongoDB database and it will allow us to give more structure to our data with the addition of models and schemas.|
Object Relation Mapping (ORM)| An Object relational model is a combination of a Object oriented database model and a Relational database model. So, it supports objects, classes, inheritance etc. just like Object Oriented models and has support for data types, tabular structures etc. like Relational data model.|
