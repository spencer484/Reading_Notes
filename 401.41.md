# React Native

### Create native apps for Android and iOS using React ###
React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### Use a little—or a lot. ### 
You can use React Native today in your existing Android and iOS projects or you can create a whole new app from scratch.


### Written in JavaScript—rendered with native code ###

React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.

Many platforms, one React. Create platform-specific versions of components so a single codebase can share code across platforms. With React Native, one team can maintain two platforms and share a common technology—React.
