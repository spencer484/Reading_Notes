# Props and State


1. Does a deployed React application require a server?

  Yes a React development server will be created upon `npm start`

2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?



3. What does npm run build do?

Bundles the app into static files for production

4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application

The entry point in our React project is the `src/index.js` file. This file is where we call `ReactDOM.render`, and send in our main `<App />` component. We will be putting all of the content in our `<App />` component in the `div` with `id=root`. By importing the `<App />` component, we can then put all of our React code within that component. That brings us over to `src/App.js`. This file will be where we can actually point the rest of our code towards. It looks something like this:

```
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
 
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

This is the default React landing page. When you navigate to your project and run npm run start, you will notice this page displays in your browser. However, we do not need this code for our project to work. We can delete everything within the <div className="App">. The main import we need, though, is import React from 'react'. By importing React, we will be able to write in JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript.

Within our src folder, let's create a new folder called "components". In this folder, we will be creating all of our components. You can think of a React component as a div that contains all of the styling and JavaScript that it needs.

|Term|Description|
|----|-----------|
|BDD| Behavior Driven Development|
|Acceptance Tests| Since ATDD is just another type of TDD, it follows the red-green-refactoring cycle and maybe described like this:  1. Write a failed acceptance test. 2. Make it pass by the simplest way.   3. Refactor based on code smell(like hard code, magic number, etc). 4. Add new test based on new requirement(if we need new acceptance test, back to 1, otherwise the process just like traditional TDD)|
|mounting| The main job of React is to figure out how to modify the DOM to match what the components want to be rendered on the screen. React does so by "mounting" (adding nodes to the DOM), "unmounting" (removing them from the DOM), and "updating" (making changes to nodes already in the DOM).|
|build| `npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Inside the build/static directory will be your JavaScript and CSS files. Each filename inside of build/static will contain a unique hash of the file contents. This hash in the file name enables long term caching techniques.|
