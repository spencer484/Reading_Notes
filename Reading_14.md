### CSS Transformations, Transitions, and Animations

###### Transofroms

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

`div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}`
