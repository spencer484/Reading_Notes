1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

- The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.


2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

- When a new instance is only created once, like during the module.exports stage, and if the instance needs to be used again, the fn's just use a copy of the initial instantion

3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

- First bringing in express. Then setting up the handler routes and functions to guide it all out. 


|Term| Definition|
|----|-----------|
|Router Middleware| Attached to the routers, pieces of middleware are a means of tweaking the requests before they are sent to your service (or before the answer from the services are sent to the clients).|
|Dynamic Module Loading| This allows you to dynamically load modules only when they are needed, rather than having to load everything up front.|
|Singleton Pattern| A design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. Usually, the goal is to manage global application state.|
|CRUD -> REST Method Matches| Create, Read, Update, Delete|
|Mock Testing| An approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behavior of the real ones.|
