# Linked Lists

***Linked List*** - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

***Node*** - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

***Next*** - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node

***Head*** - The Head is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

***Current*** - The Current reference is a reference type of type Node that is currently being looked at. This node is traditionally used when traversing through a full linked list. When traversing, you typically reset the current to the head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.
