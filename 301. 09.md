###### WHAT!?

This kind of made sense but I am all over the place on this stuff. What?

**What is functional programming?**

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

**Pure Functions**

The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions. But what does that really mean? What makes a function pure?
So how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:
* It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
* It does not cause any observable side effects
