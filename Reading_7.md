# Read: 07 - HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions


### Domain Modeling

Domain Modeling would have helped for the begining of Salmon Cookies. This is the begining of Object-Oriented Programming. 

1.The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
2.The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
3.The object is stored in a variable for later use.

We also begin using constructor functions. I have always hated constructor funtions and will be happy to get past these haha.

### Tables

Tables are pretty staight forward. I have never had too much of a issue with them. For the most part you declare your table and then you have table rows followed by table data. You can get fancy with spanning columns and rows as well adding footers and spacing but this is a little more rare.

### Functions, Methods, and Objects

There is a lot going on in this reading. Mainly about objects and building functions. We are starting to get into a lot of different wayt to build out objects and functions. One of the big new lessons is the constructor sytax. This will build out a model for the object and then we can use the word NEW to create a new variable of what the object should be. Pass that into the constructor and then reuse the constructor function over and over. This will save time and be more efficient. This chapter also covered the .Math function which hopefully I can redo on the Salmon Cookie assignment to get that working better.
