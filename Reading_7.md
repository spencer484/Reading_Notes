# Read: 07 - HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions


### Domain Modeling

Domain Modeling would have helped for the begining of Salmon Cookies. This is the begining of Object-Oriented Programming. 

1.The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
2.The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
3.The object is stored in a variable for later use.

We also begin using constructor functions. I have always hated constructor funtions and will be happy to get past these haha.

### Tables

Tables are pretty staight forward. I have never had too much of a issue with them. For the most part you declare your <table> and then you have table rows <tr> followed by table data <td>. You can get fancy with spanning columns and rows as well adding footers and spacing but this is a little more rare.
