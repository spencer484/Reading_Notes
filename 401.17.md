# TCP Servers


The **WebSocket** API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

Web sockets were designed to help solve this dilemma of creating a real-time environment without pinging the server every 500ms. Web sockets work by generating an "agreement" so to speak. This "agreement" is called a handshake. Once the handshake is complete, both the client and the server can send data to each other without making another HTTP request. 

```
const socket = io('ws://localhost:3000');

socket.on('connect', () => {
  // either with send()
  socket.send('Hello!');

  // or with emit() and custom event names
  socket.emit('salutations', 'Hello!', { 'mr': 'john' }, Uint8Array.from([1, 2, 3, 4]));
});

// handle the event sent with socket.send()
socket.on('message', data => {
  console.log(data);
});

// handle the event sent with socket.emit()
socket.on('greetings', (elem1, elem2, elem3) => {
  console.log(elem1, elem2, elem3);
});
```

A good way to visualize the client/server interaction with sockets is a tennis match. When one side sends a message, or emits an event, it's like one player has hit the ball to the other side of the court. Then, depending on the type of message, the receiving side may decide to send a message in response back to the sender, or hit the ball to the other side of the court. It's this ongoing back and forth communication that makes sockets such a powerful technology.

Emitting Events from the Server
With sockets, the individual clients don't communicate directly with one another; instead all communications must pass through the server. There are multiple ways for the server to emit events to connected clients, depending on which clients you intend to reach. They are all functions and all three take in two arguments: 1) the event name, and 2) optionally any data you want to send along with the event.

* io.emit emits an event to all connected clients
* socket.broadcast.emit emits an event to all clients other than this particular one, referenced by the socket variable
* socket.emit emits an event directly to this specific client
