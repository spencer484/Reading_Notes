# Component Composition

1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component?

The best way to access child state from a parent component is through callback functions, such as onChange or onSubmit. You can also use useRef to get the initial state from a child component.

2. What can be passed along in a prop variable?

Props, short for properties, is an empty object that is passed to every React component by default. To pass props down to our child components, we simply need to add an html attribute to our component. Each attribute will become a key in the props object and each value given to that attribute will become the value of that key.

To access props in a class component, we will need to precede the props with the keyword this. Because our class components extend React.Component, we already have access to the props variable that React has defined in the Component class.

```
class Header extends React.Component {
    render() {
        const { firstName, lastName } = this.props;
        return (
            <div>
              // Destructuring allows us to use them like variables. This is just a small amount of syntactical sugar.
                <h1>My name is { firstName}  { lastName }</h1>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```


3. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

Components can also have children. Children of components are those element(s)/component(s) that are within the two "tags" of JSX elements.

Let's say we have the following App.js.

```
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import MyNewComponent from './components/MyNewComponent';
    
    
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
        <MyNewComponent header={ "Header Prop" }>
            <p>This is a child</p>
            <p>This is another child</p>
            <p>This is even another child</p>
        </MyNewComponent>  
    </div>
  );
}
    
export default App;
```

We have a Component called MyNewComponent. There is one prop called header which we can access within our MyNewComponent.js. We also have some text between the JSX tags. All components between these two are called "children". We can access them via the following:

**MyNewComponent.js**

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
    
    
class MyNewComponent extends Component{
    render(){
        return(
            <div>
                <h1>
                    { this.props.header }
                </h1>
                { this.props.children }
            </div>
        );
    }
}
    
export default MyNewComponent;
```

|component state| A component’s state is the datastore that contains the data that should be rendered by the component. The data in the component’s state is preserved even if React re-renders the component.|
