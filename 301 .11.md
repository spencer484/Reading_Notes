### EJS

EJS stands for Embedded JavaScript

**EJS:** EJS or Embedded Javascript Templating is a templating engine used by Node.js. Template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into HTML template at the client side and produce the final HTML. EJS is a simple templating language which is used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It also helps to embed JavaScript to HTML pages. 

Honestly I am stil pretty confused on what exactly EJS does. Hoping to learn more today...
