1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

* TDD ensures that your system actually meets requirements defined for it. It helps to build your confidence about your system.
* In TDD, you achieve 100% coverage test. Every single line of code is tested, unlike traditional testing.
* When a test fails, you have made progress because you know that you need to resolve the problem.

2. what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

The BeforeEach and AfterEach commands allow you to define setup and teardown tasks that are performed at the beginning and end of every It block. This can eliminate duplication of code in test scripts, ensure that each test is performed on a pristine state regardless of their order, and perform any necessary cleanup tasks after each test.

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development

Poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time

4. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

ES6 classes help you do the same thing but in potentially less lines of code and lines of code that are easier to read as a developer than the traditional consturot/prototype way.

5. Name a use case for a static method

Use static imports only when you were tempted to "abuse inheritance". 

6. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves

In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following: takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. procedural parameters), returns a function as its result. All other functions are first-order functions. In mathematics higher-order functions are also termed operators or functionals. The differential operator in calculus is a common example, since it maps a function to its derivative, also a function.

```
const twice = (f, v) => f(f(v));
const add3 = v => v + 3;

twice(add3, 7); // 13
```


| Term | Definition |
|------|:-----------|
|functional programming| Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the state of the program.
|pure function| This means when a same input is passed every time, the function will return same output
|higher-order function| Higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following: takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. procedural parameters), returns a function as its result. 
|immutable state| Immutable state is state that cannot be changed. Immutable objects (for which none of the state can be changed) become important when you are dealing with concurrency, the ability for more than one processor in your computer to operate on that object at the same time.
|object| An object, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is an abstract data type created by a developer. It can include multiple properties and methods and may even contain other objects. In most programming languages, objects are defined as classes.
|object-oriented programming (OOP)| Programming methodology based on objects, instead of just functions and procedures. These objects are organized into classes, which allow individual objects to be grouped together. 
|class| A class is used in object-oriented programming to describe one or more objects. It serves as a template for creating, or instantiating, specific objects within a program. 
|prototype| All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype
|super| The super keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.
|inheritance| When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.
|constructor| A constructor enables you to provide any custom initialization that must be done before any other methods can be called on an instantiated object. If you don't provide your own constructor, then a default constructor will be supplied for you.
|instance| Instance is nothing but an object that you create out of a constructor function in javascript. Javascript does not have anything called class, but you can create functions which behave like a class.
|context| In JavaScript, “ context ” refers to an object. Within an object, the keyword “ this ” refers to that object (i.e. “self”), and provides an interface to the properties and methods that are members of that object. When a function is executed, the keyword “this” refers to the object that the function is executed in.
|this| The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used: In a method, this refers to the owner object. Alone, this refers to the global object.
|Test Driven Development (TDD)| Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.
|Jest| Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.
|Continuous Integration (CI)| In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. 
|unit test| In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
