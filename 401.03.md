# Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases



1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

* TDD ensures that your system actually meets requirements defined for it. It helps to build your confidence about your system.
* In TDD, you achieve 100% coverage test. Every single line of code is tested, unlike traditional testing.
* When a test fails, you have made progress because you know that you need to resolve the problem.

2. what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

The BeforeEach and AfterEach commands allow you to define setup and teardown tasks that are performed at the beginning and end of every It block. This can eliminate duplication of code in test scripts, ensure that each test is performed on a pristine state regardless of their order, and perform any necessary cleanup tasks after each test.

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development

Poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time

4. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

5. Name a use case for a static method

Use static imports only when you were tempted to "abuse inheritance". 

6. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves
