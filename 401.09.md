1. How does route prefixing work with an external routing module?

- External routes can be a great way to keep your code organized, maintainable, and easy to understand; they help create a structure that is easy to examine in order to locate a particular piece related to your work.

2. When routing, what’s the difference between ```app.get('/data/:id')``` and ```app.get('/data/:name')```?

- They are different names in the handler function that refer to the req.params

3. Explain how Express handles routing conflicts?

- Middleware execution normally stops the first time a piece of middleware calls next() with an error. However, there is a special kind of post middleware called "error handling middleware" that executes specifically when an error occurs. Error handling middleware is useful for reporting errors and making error messages more readable.

4. What are the ways that a browser can send “data” or request variables to an HTTP server

- req.body // http verbs for it are POST, PATCH, PUT, also can be headers and GET but don't use get since that puts data in the url which isn't private


|Term|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Routing| A Javascript router is a key component in most frontend frameworks. It is the piece of software in charge to organize the states of the application, switching between different views. The router will be in charge of simulating transitions between documents by watching changes on the URL. When the document is reloaded or the URL is modified somehow, it will detect that change and render the view that is associated with the new URL.| 
|Route Prefixing| Route prefixes are associated with routes by design in attribute routing. It is used to set a common prefix for an entire controller.|
|Request “Body”| RequestBody holds data related to the request body. By default, it provides a nice wrapper for url-encoded, form-data, and raw types of request bodies.|
|Request “Query”| This property is an object containing a property for each query string parameter in the route. When query parser is set to disabled, it is an empty object {}, otherwise it is the result of the configured query parser.|
|Request “Params”| This property is an object containing properties mapped to the named route “parameters”. For example, if you have the route /user/:name, then the “name” property is available as req.params.name. This object defaults to {}.|
